# F1_DNF_prediction
Predicting whether a Formula 1 driver will Did Not Finish (DNF) a race using machine learning. This project leverages historical F1 race data and a Random Forest Classifier to make predictions.

# Project Overview
In Formula 1, predicting a DNF (Did Not Finish) can provide insights into race strategy, reliability issues, and driver performance. This project uses race and driver features to predict whether a driver will finish the race or not.

Key points:

Uses historical F1 race data.

Features include race details, driver statistics, constructor info, circuit data, and more.

Uses RandomForestClassifier from scikit-learn for prediction.

Can be deployed with Streamlit or other web apps for interactive predictions.

# Model Performance
Feature Importance: Understand which factors influence DNF most
